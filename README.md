# AtlasFN

AtlasFn is a private server, that lets you have all cosmetics in your locker and a lobby bot

Atlas is open source software, and will always be free. [AltasFN on GitHub](https://github.com/atlasfn) supports collaboration between its developer, and its *user community*, providing a place to transparently report issues, collect feedback and discuss future direction.

# The AtlasFN Issues Repo

The repo you are looking at is the Atlas Issues Repo. It exists as a public forum to gather users' feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features or desired enhancements. For questions on how to use Atlas, or any issues you are experiencing, see [How to get support](#how-to-get-support).

While you can use email to send bug reports or suggestions, I and the AtlasFN community prefer you use this public forum for the sake of transparency and efficiency.  

As a developer I want to make AtlasFN perfect. I welcome all user ideas and opinions.

## How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

1. Open the `Issues` tab above. Search existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it. 
2. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
3. If not, click the `New Issue` button and explain. 
   -  For bug reports, **please provide your OS version, AtlasFN version, and if possible, detailed steps to reproduce the bug**.

If you have multiple bugs or requests that are not closely related, please separate them into different issues.
